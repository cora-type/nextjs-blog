**JULY**

Ironically I built and learned more about web development this month than I ever did in college. I feel like college focuses way too much on DS/A, but given how proficiency in DS/A usually ends up being the deciding factor between whether you get a job or not in most cases I can't fault it for doing so.

**AUGUST**

Built Coalesce. Really fun and kind of challenging, but useful to me and I still use it myself to this day. Looking back especially at the design, I think I did a bit too much with the font and logo but I'm no designer, yet.

**SEPTEMBER**

Being a turtle and just staying home all day programming took it's toll I guess. Mental health issues kinda crept up on me and I somehow managed to get Insomnia ðŸ¥´. Working through it without medication was rough but I've always been very adamant on not tuning the brain with drugs that even the researchers involved in making it have no idea the extent to which it affects the brain. Funnily enough I guess I was right considering not a few weeks later a massive study came out about anti-depressants possibly being a complete farce and having no more of an impact than a placebo pill. Personally, I went from having nights where I would sleep 30 minutes - 2 hours max after struggling to even fall asleep for hours, to now where I sleep nearly instantly and only awake 1-2 times. The Calm app, more specifically Jay Shetty, played a big role in getting where I am right now.
