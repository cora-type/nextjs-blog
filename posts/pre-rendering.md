<!-- Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others. -->

**JULY**

Most of my time was spent brushing up on some basics & essentials that really just helped strengthen my foundations. Even with my college experience, it's clear to me now how approachable programming is for people who have never even seen code before. I guess college's emphasis on Data Structures & Algorithms scares a lot of people, when in reality thats only a very small part of whats actually done when building things. Realistically, I should have built these basic apps years ago, like the to-do list, but I guess I never saw the value in it - till now at least.

**AUGUST**

Built a simple tool using Reddit's API and a Python script TO make Google-Reddit searches easier.
